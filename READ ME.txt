The application starts by execution of the jar file. There are no command line arguments.To run the jar file 
command is: java -jar jarfilename.jar

To run the application you need to have a menu file.

Format of menu file.

<Item-id>   "<Item name>"	cost

Ex : 

1	    "Item 1"		20
2	    "Item 2"		40

We used tab as a delimiter for the menu file. So while adding a new item, make sure that you give tab after each column.


After executing the jar file the customer entered data is stored in files.The path is RMS\src\files.We can see all 
the data through this files(bills.txt,customer.txt,menuFile.txt,orders.txt) 


jar file path is: RMS\target
